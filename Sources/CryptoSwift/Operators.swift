 Bit shifting with overflow protection using overflow operator "&".
 Approach is consistent with standard overflow operators &+, &-, &*, &/
 and introduce new overflow operators for shifting: &<<, &>>

 Note: Works with unsigned integers values only

 Usage

 var i = 1       // init
 var j = i &<< 2 //shift left
 j &<<= 2        //shift left and assign

 @see: https://medium.com/@krzyzanowskim/swiftly-shift-bits-and-protect-yourself-be33016ce071

 This fuctonality is now implemented as part of Swift 3, SE-0104 https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md
