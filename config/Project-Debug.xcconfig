// Strip Debug Symbols During Copy
// 
// Specifies whether binary files that are copied during the build, such as in a Copy
// Bundle Resources or Copy Files build phase, should be stripped of debugging symbols.
// It does not cause the linked product of a target to be strippedâ€”use
// `STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT` for that.

// Enable Testability
//

// running automated tests, such as making private interfaces accessible to the tests.
// This may result in tests running slower than they would without testability enabled.
