// Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries
// 
// Always embed the Swift standard libraries in the target's products, even if the target
// does not contain any Swift code.  For example, this should be enabled if the target is
// embedding other products which contain Swift, or if it is a test target which does not
// contain Swift but which is testing a product which does.  This setting only applies to
// wrapped products, not to standalone binary products.
